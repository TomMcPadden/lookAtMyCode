# Look At My Code (PHP version)

A web application which outputs an interface for displaying multiple codes/scripts of any extension, predominantly focused on user friendliness.

The "lookAtMeNow.php", "body.php", "style.css", and "javascript.js" files are required. lookAtMyNow.php and body.php must be in the same directory, or else you'll need to configure the class variables of lookAtMeNow.php.
